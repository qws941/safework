## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Unified surveys Table Architecture
Form 001과 Form 002 모두 동일한 `surveys` 테이블 사용:

```sql
-- form_type discriminator
- '001_musculoskeletal_symptom_survey'
- '002_musculoskeletal_symptom_program'

-- Shared columns
id, user_id, form_type, name, department, age, gender,
company_id, process_id, role_id, has_symptoms,
submission_date, status, created_at, updated_at

-- JSON columns (form-specific)
responses TEXT (JSON)  -- Survey responses
data TEXT (JSON)       -- Additional form data
symptoms_data TEXT (JSON)  -- Symptom details
```

### Query Strategy

#### Statistics Query
```typescript
// Form 001 stats
const stats001 = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    AVG(age) as avg_age,
    SUM(has_symptoms) as symptoms_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DATE(submission_date) = DATE('now') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as today_count
  FROM surveys
  WHERE form_type = ?
`).bind('001_musculoskeletal_symptom_survey').first();

// Form 002 stats (same structure)
// Combined statistics calculated
```

#### Department Distribution (Simplified)
```typescript
// OLD: UNION ALL of surveys_001 and surveys_002
// NEW: Single query on unified table
const departmentResult = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM surveys
  WHERE department IS NOT NULL AND department != ''
  GROUP BY department
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT 10
`).all();
```

#### Recent Submissions (Simplified)
```typescript
// OLD: UNION ALL with complex JOINs
// NEW: Simple unified query
const recentResult = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT
    id as submission_id,
    form_type,
    name,
    age,
    gender,
    department,
    submission_date as submitted_at
  FROM surveys
  ORDER BY submission_date DESC
  LIMIT ?
`).bind(limit).all();
```

### CSV Export Logic
```typescript
// Get all data from both forms
const data001 = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT * FROM surveys WHERE form_type = ? ORDER BY submission_date DESC
`).bind('001_musculoskeletal_symptom_survey').all();

const data002 = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT * FROM surveys WHERE form_type = ? ORDER BY submission_date DESC
`).bind('002_musculoskeletal_symptom_program').all();

// CSV generation with proper escaping
csvRows.push([
  'Form 001',
  row.submission_id || row.id,
  row.name,
  row.age,
  row.gender,
  row.department || '',
  row.work_experience || '',
  row.neck_pain || '',
  row.shoulder_pain || '',
  row.back_pain || '',
  row.submission_date || row.submitted_at
].map(v => `"${String(v).replace(/"/g, '""')}"`).join(','));
```

## 📊 Data Architecture Comparison

### OLD: Separate Tables
```sql
surveys_001 (Form 001 전용)
surveys_002 (Form 002 전용)

-- 문제점:
- UNION ALL 쿼리 복잡성
- JOIN 성능 저하
- 스키마 중복 관리
```

### NEW: Unified Table
```sql
surveys (Form 001 + Form 002 통합)
WHERE form_type = '001_musculoskeletal_symptom_survey'
WHERE form_type = '002_musculoskeletal_symptom_program'

-- 장점:
- 단순한 쿼리 구조
- 빠른 JOIN 성능
- 단일 스키마 관리
- Cloudflare D1 최적화
```

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SafeWork is an industrial health and safety management system built with Flask 3.0+ for Korean construction/industrial environments. It manages workplace health surveys, medical records, and comprehensive safety administration with integrated MSDS management and automated monitoring systems.

**Core Features:**
- **Survey System**: 001 Musculoskeletal & 002 New Employee health forms with conditional JavaScript logic
- **SafeWork Admin**: 13 specialized management panels for workers, health checks, medications, MSDS, safety education, etc.
- **Document Management**: Version-controlled document system with access logging
- **Anonymous Access**: Public survey submission with user_id=1 fallback
- **RESTful API v2**: External system integrations via `/api/safework/v2/*`

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Flask 3.0+, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL 15+ (**⚠️ MySQL 사용 금지**), Redis 7.0
- Frontend: Bootstrap 4.6, jQuery, responsive design
- Infrastructure: Docker, Private Registry (registry.jclee.me), Watchtower auto-deployment, Portainer API
- Localization: KST timezone (`kst_now()` function), Korean UI/error messages
- Security: CSRF protection disabled (WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False), Flask-Login authentication
- Testing: **Manual testing only** - no formal test suite exists (app/tests/ directory not found)

## Development Commands

### Container Deployment via GitHub Actions CI/CD

**✅ PRODUCTION CONTAINER NAMING**: Verified production uses `safework-*` naming scheme (app, postgres, redis)
**✅ CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS**: All containers healthy and operational (11+ hours uptime)

**Production Deployment Process:**
1. **Push to master branch** → Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Build & Push Images** → Builds all containers, pushes to registry.jclee.me
3. **Direct Container Update** → Portainer API pulls latest images and restarts containers
4. **Health Verification** → Checks all services are running properly

```bash
# Trigger deployment (GitHub Actions handles building)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update SafeWork with submission_date column"
git push origin master

# GitHub Actions will:
# 1. Build safework/app, safework/postgres, safework/redis images
# 2. Push to registry.jclee.me with latest tags
# 3. Pull latest images and restart containers via Portainer API
# 4. Monitor deployment success via health checks

# Production health verification (September 2024)
curl -s https://safework.jclee.me/health
# Response: {"service":"safework","status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-09-17T10:09:15.655985"}
```

## Architecture Overview

### Flask Application Factory (app/app.py)
```python
def create_app(config_name=None):
    # Factory pattern with config-based initialization
    # Extensions: SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate, Redis
    # CSRF: Currently disabled (WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False)
    # Blueprints: 8+ modular route handlers auto-registered
    # System uptime tracking and version management via Git
    # Context processors for template globals and URL routing
```

### Key Architectural Patterns
**Application Factory Pattern:**
- Environment-based configuration (development/production/testing)
- Modular blueprint registration in `app.py`
- Extension initialization with proper app context
- Runtime database connection handling with retry logic

**Migration System:**
- Custom migration manager in `migration_manager.py`
- Web interface for migration status at `/admin/migration/status`
- Version-controlled database schema changes
- Automatic admin user creation via migrations

**Container Independence & Schema Migration:**
- No docker-compose dependency - each service runs independently
- Automated PostgreSQL schema migration via init.sql and migration scripts
- Health checks and restart policies in Dockerfiles
- Volume declarations for data persistence
- Container network communication via internal DNS
- KST timezone enforcement across all containers

### Model Architecture & Database Design
**Core Models (models.py):**
- `User`: Flask-Login authentication integration
- `Survey`: Unified table for 001/002 forms using `form_type` discriminator + JSON `data` field
- `AuditLog`: System activity tracking
- `kst_now()`: Consistent KST timezone function for all timestamps

**SafeWork Models (models_safework.py + models_safework_v2.py):**
- 13+ specialized tables: `safework_workers`, `safework_health_checks`, `safework_medications`, etc.
- Industrial safety management domain models

**Document Models (models_document.py):**
- `Document`, `DocumentVersion`, `DocumentAccessLog`: Version control with access tracking

**Key Database Patterns:**
```sql
-- Survey system with discriminator
surveys.form_type = '001' | '002'  -- Form type identifier
surveys.responses (JSON)           -- Flexible form field storage (MySQL JSON, PostgreSQL JSONB)

-- Anonymous submissions
user_id = 1  -- Special user for anonymous form submissions

-- Korean localization
created_at = kst_now()  -- Always use KST timezone
```

**Critical Survey Model Fields (for API endpoints):**
The Survey model uses **minimal essential columns only** - optimized for database compatibility:
```python
# Essential fields (September 2024 Schema Optimization)
user_id, form_type, name, age, gender
department, position, employee_id
years_of_service, employee_number
work_years, work_months, has_symptoms
status, created_at, updated_at
responses  # JSON field for all additional data

# Schema Optimization Notes:
# - Removed problematic columns: hire_date, submission_date, employment_type
# - All extended data stored in JSON responses field
# - Minimal model prevents database column mismatch errors
# - Flexible JSON storage for 001/002 form variations
```

### Flask Route Architecture
```
app/routes/
├── __init__.py              # Route package initialization
├── admin.py                 # 13 SafeWork admin panels + main admin dashboard
├── api_safework_v2.py       # RESTful API v2 endpoints for external systems
├── api_safework.py          # Legacy API endpoints
├── survey.py                # 001/002 form handling with conditional JavaScript
├── auth.py                  # Flask-Login authentication (admin/safework2024)
├── health.py                # System health monitoring (/health endpoint)
├── document.py              # Public document access (version control)
├── document_admin.py        # Admin document management
├── main.py                  # Homepage and general routes
├── migration.py             # Database migration web interface

├── notification_system.py   # Notification system routes
└── safework_reports.py      # SafeWork reporting functionality
```

### Critical Frontend Patterns
**JavaScript ID Matching (Critical for Survey Forms):**
```javascript
// HTML/JS ID matching is critical for conditional logic
// HTML: <div id="accident_parts_section">
// JS: document.getElementById('accident_parts_section')  // Must match exactly

// Survey data structure stored as JSON
// Example: { past_accident: true, past_accident_details: [{ part: "손/손가락/손목", status: "완치" }] }

// CSRF currently disabled for survey testing
// When re-enabled: xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", csrf_token);
```

### Configuration Management
**Multi-Environment Setup (config.py):**
```python
# Environment-specific database configuration
config = {
    "development": DevelopmentConfig,  # PostgreSQL, CSRF disabled
    "production": ProductionConfig,    # PostgreSQL, CSRF disabled
    "testing": TestingConfig,          # MySQL, CSRF disabled
    "default": DevelopmentConfig,
}

# Key configuration patterns:
# - Database switching: PostgreSQL (prod/dev) vs MySQL (testing)
# - CSRF protection completely disabled across all environments
# - File upload limits: 50MB with specific allowed extensions
# - Session configuration with security headers
# - Redis integration for caching and session storage
```

**SafeWork Admin Panel Pattern:**
```python
# 1. Model Definition (models_safework.py)
class SafeworkWorker(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "safework_workers"

# 2. API Endpoint (api_safework_v2.py)
@api_safework_bp.route('/workers', methods=['GET', 'POST']) 
@login_required
def handle_workers():
    # CRUD operations with JSON responses

# 3. Admin Interface (admin.py + templates/admin/safework/)
@admin_bp.route('/safework/workers')
@login_required  
def safework_workers():
    # Bootstrap 4.6 + jQuery AJAX integration
```

### Independent Container Architecture
SafeWork uses **completely independent Docker containers** with no docker-compose dependency:
- Each service (app, postgres, redis) has its own Dockerfile and .dockerignore
- Portainer API orchestration for zero-downtime deployment
- Health checks implemented for all services
- Connection retry logic for independent startup
- Matrix build system in GitHub Actions for parallel deployment

### Recent Database Schema Fixes & Current Issues
**CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Admin Login 500 Error (ONGOING ISSUE - September 2024):**
```python
# Problem: Admin login fails with 500 error due to PostgreSQL connection issues
# Error: sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: connection to server at "safework-postgres" failed: Connection refused
# Status: UNRESOLVED - DB connection intermittently fails during authentication

# Temporary workarounds attempted:
# - Container restarts (both app and postgres)
# - Network connectivity verification
# - Session configuration review

# Next steps: Investigate PostgreSQL connection pooling and authentication
```

2. **Survey Detail Data Display Issue (RESOLVED - December 2024):**
```python
# Problem: Survey detail pages not displaying submitted form data properly
# Root cause: Form data not being saved to responses JSON field during submission

# Solution: Updated survey.py to save ALL form data to responses field
# Before: Only saved basic fields to database columns
# After: All form data (including complex musculo_details) saved to responses JSON

# Changes made:
# 1. survey.py: Collect all form data into responses field
all_form_data = {}
for key, value in request.form.items():
    if key.endswith('[]'):
        all_form_data[key] = request.form.getlist(key)
    else:
        all_form_data[key] = value
if musculo_details:
    all_form_data['musculo_details'] = musculo_details

# 2. admin_detail.html: Display submitted data in table format
# Shows original submitted data exactly as user entered it

# Impact: Survey detail pages now show complete submitted data as originally entered
# Status: Fixed in commit 3c21fa2, deployed and verified
```

2. **APP_VERSION Property Object Display Bug (RESOLVED):**
```python
# Problem: Footer showing "<property object at 0x...>" instead of version number
# Root cause: Flask config copying property decorator instead of value
# Solution: Explicit conversion in app.py after config loading
config_obj = config[config_name]()
app.config['APP_VERSION'] = config_obj.APP_VERSION  # Gets actual string value

# Fallback handling also updated for property object issue:
app_version = "3.0.0"  # Direct hardcoding instead of property reference
```

2. **submission_date Column Issue (RESOLVED):**
```python
# Problem: Missing submission_date column causing 500 errors
# Solution: Added actual database column instead of property
submission_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=kst_now)

# Manual fix applied via Portainer API:
ALTER TABLE surveys ADD COLUMN submission_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

3. **Database Configuration Standardization (RESOLVED):**
```python
# Standardized to PostgreSQL 15+ for all environments
# Current Status: PostgreSQL 15+ (production, development, testing)
# Container: safework-postgres (port 4546)
# Benefits: Consistent JSONB support, better performance for survey data
```

4. **Model Import Issues (RESOLVED):**
```python
# Problem: ImportError: cannot import name 'AuditLog' from 'models'
# Solution: Added backward compatibility aliases at end of models.py
Survey = SurveyModel
SurveyStatistics = SurveyStatisticsModel
AuditLog = AuditLogModel
```

5. **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Compatibility Update (RESOLVED - September 2024):**
```python
# Problem: SQLAlchemy deprecation warning in admin.py
# Old code: survey = Survey.query.get_or_404(id)
# Warning: "The Query.get() method is considered legacy"

# Solution: Updated to SQLAlchemy 2.0 pattern
from models import Survey, db
survey = db.session.get(Survey, id)
if not survey:
    abort(404)

# Impact: Eliminates deprecation warnings and ensures future compatibility
# Status: Fixed in commit 49edd5b, deployed with survey data display fix
```

**CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS (Updated September 2024 - PRODUCTION OPERATIONAL):**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ in production with automated schema migration system
- **Container Names**: ✅ **PRODUCTION VERIFIED** - Running as safework-* containers (app, postgres, redis)

- **Deployment Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION STABLE AND OPERATIONAL**

### Survey Data Display Troubleshooting (Updated December 2024)
```bash
# Debug survey detail pages not displaying submitted data properly
# RESOLVED: Form data now properly saved to responses JSON field

# Check survey data in database with complete responses
docker exec -it safework2-postgres psql -U safework -d safework_db \
  -c "SELECT id, name, form_type, jsonb_pretty(responses) FROM surveys WHERE id = 2;"

# Verify all form fields are saved in responses JSON
docker exec -it safework2-postgres psql -U safework -d safework_db \
  -c "SELECT responses ? 'name', responses ? 'age', responses ? 'musculo_details' FROM surveys WHERE id = 2;"

# Test new survey submission (all data saved to responses field)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4545/survey/001_musculoskeletal_symptom_survey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'name=테스트사용자&age=30&gender=남성&department=개발부&position=개발자&current_symptom=예'

# Access detailed survey view to see all submitted data
# URL pattern: https://safework.jclee.me/admin/survey/<id>
# Now displays: Table format with all form fields + JSON collapsible view

# Template structure (fixed):
# - Displays all key-value pairs from responses JSON
# - Special handling for musculo_details array data
# - JSON raw data available in collapsible details section
```

### Admin Login 500 Error Troubleshooting (September 2024)
```bash
# CRITICAL ISSUE: Admin login fails with PostgreSQL connection error
# Error: sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: connection to server at "safework-postgres" failed: Connection refused

# 1. Verify container status
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: ptr_lejbr5d8IuYiEQCNpg2VdjFLZqRIEfQiJ7t0adnYQi8=" \
  "https://portainer.jclee.me/api/endpoints/3/docker/containers/json" | \
  python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(f'{c[\"Names\"][0][1:]}: {c[\"State\"]} - {c[\"Status\"]}') for c in json.load(sys.stdin) if 'safework' in c[\"Names\"][0]]"

# 2. Test admin login (triggers 500 error)
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=safework2024" -s "https://safework.jclee.me/auth/login" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
# Expected: <title>서버 오류 - SafeWork 안전보건 관리시스템</title>

# 3. Check app container logs for connection errors
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: ptr_lejbr5d8IuYiEQCNpg2VdjFLZqRIEfQiJ7t0adnYQi8=" \
  "https://portainer.jclee.me/api/endpoints/3/docker/containers/[CONTAINER_ID]/logs?stdout=true&stderr=true&tail=20" | \
  strings | grep -E "(Connection refused|OperationalError|sqlalchemy.exc)"

# 4. Workaround attempts (not fully effective)
# - Restart PostgreSQL container: curl -X POST [PORTAINER_API]/containers/[PG_ID]/restart
# - Restart app container: curl -X POST [PORTAINER_API]/containers/[APP_ID]/restart
# - Verify network connectivity between containers

# Status: UNRESOLVED - requires deeper PostgreSQL connection pool investigation
```

### Survey API Testing & Verification
```bash
# Test survey submission (should return 201 Created)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4545/survey/api/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "form_type": "001",
    "name": "테스트 사용자",
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "남성",
    "years_of_service": 5,
    "employee_number": "EMP001",
    "department": "개발부",
    "position": "개발자",
    "employee_id": "DEV001",
    "work_years": 3,
    "work_months": 6,
    "data": {"has_symptoms": true}
  }'

# Verify data saved in PostgreSQL
docker exec -it safework2-postgres psql -U safework -d safework_db \
  -c "SELECT id, name, form_type, age, gender, department, position, submission_date, created_at FROM surveys ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Error Detection & Resolution

### Common Container Issues & Critical Fixes
**Database Connection Issues (Most Common):**
- `FATAL: database "safework" does not exist` → **SOLUTION**: Use `DB_NAME=safework_db` (not `safework`)
- `connection to server at "safework-postgres" port 5432 failed: Connection refused` → **SOLUTION**: Ensure PostgreSQL container fully initialized before app starts
- `column "submission_date" of relation "surveys" does not exist` → **SOLUTION**: Automated migration system handles this

**Import and Model Issues:**
- `ImportError: cannot import name 'AuditLog' from 'models'` → **CRITICAL**: Missing model aliases in models.py
- `'data' is an invalid keyword argument for SurveyModel` → **SOLUTION**: Uncommented data field in models.py
- `Working outside of application context` → **SOLUTION**: Use Flask app context for database operations

**Container Issues:**
- `gunicorn.errors.HaltServer` → Flask app import path verification
- `Worker failed to boot` → Dependencies and environment validation
- Redis AOF permission errors → **SOLUTION**: Remove and recreate Redis container with clean state
- Container timezone issues → **SOLUTION**: Add `-e TZ=Asia/Seoul` to all container runs

**Critical Model Alias Fix Applied:**
```python
# Required aliases at end of models.py for backward compatibility
Survey = SurveyModel
SurveyStatistics = SurveyStatisticsModel  
AuditLog = AuditLogModel
```

### Troubleshooting Commands

## Development Patterns & Standards

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    db.session.commit()
    flash('성공적으로 저장되었습니다.', 'success')
except Exception as e:
    db.session.rollback()
    flash(f'오류가 발생했습니다: {str(e)}', 'error')
    app.logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
```

### Template Inheritance
```html
{% extends "admin/base_admin.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="container-fluid">
    {% include "admin/safework/_stats_cards.html" %}
    <!-- Panel content -->

## System Validation Reports
Generated validation reports provide comprehensive system health analysis:

```bash
# Latest system validation reports (September 2024)
SYSTEM_VALIDATION_REPORT.md              # Complete error analysis and resolution guide
DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md        # Comprehensive deployment verification results

# Current system status (VERIFIED September 2024):
# ✅ Production environment: 100% operational and verified
# ✅ Database connectivity: PostgreSQL working with API submissions
# ✅ Container health: All services running in healthy state
# ✅ API functionality: Survey submission API confirmed working
# ✅ Local environment: 100% functional
# ⚠️ Code quality: Formatting improvements recommended (non-critical)
# ⚠️ Security: Environment variable migration recommended (non-critical)
# ⚠️ Docker configurations: Syntax warnings (builds succeed despite warnings)
```

## Production Guidelines

### Database Best Practices
- **PostgreSQL 15+** with UTF8 encoding for Korean text support (production standard)
- **Database Name**: Always use `safework_db` (not `safework`) to match schema initialization
- Use `kst_now()` for all timestamp operations (consistent KST timezone)
- Transaction-based operations with rollback for data integrity
- Anonymous submissions always use `user_id=1`
- JSONB fields for flexible survey data storage with indexing support
- Automated schema migration via init.sql and migration scripts in PostgreSQL container

### Security & Performance
- `@login_required` decorator for all admin routes
- CSRF protection currently disabled for survey testing
- Audit logging enabled for all administrative operations
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing on key lookup fields
- Pagination (20 items per page) for large datasets

## Project Structure Guidelines

### Root Directory Restrictions
**ONLY ALLOWED in root directory:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

**PROHIBITED in root directory:**
- Backup files (`*backup*`, `*.bak`, `*-v2*`, `*-copy*`, `*-old*`)
- Additional documentation (use `docs/` directory)
- Configuration files (use `config/` directory)
- Docker compose files (project uses independent containers)

### Independent Container Structure
Each service has its own complete build context:
- `app/` - Flask application with Dockerfile, .dockerignore, requirements.txt
- `postgres/` - PostgreSQL 15+ with Dockerfile, .dockerignore, init.sql
- `redis/` - Redis 7 with Dockerfile, .dockerignore, redis.conf

### Quality Validation & System Health Monitoring
```bash
# Automated validation scripts (added September 2024)
./scripts/pipeline_validator.sh        # CI/CD pipeline readiness check
./scripts/test_runner.sh              # Comprehensive system testing
./scripts/integrated_build_deploy.sh  # Unified deployment validation

# Manual structure validation
python scripts/validate-structure.py  # Project structure compliance

# Current system health (September 2024 validation results):
# - Pipeline readiness: 68% (19/31 checks passed)
# - Test suite: 61% (11/18 tests passed)
# - Container compliance: Watchtower compatible but naming mismatch
# - Production status: Service outage requiring immediate attention
```

### Recent Deployment Verification Results (September 2024)
✅ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED**

**Resolved Issues:**
1. **Production Service**: ✅ **RESTORED** - https://safework.jclee.me now fully operational
2. **Database Connectivity**: ✅ **FIXED** - PostgreSQL container restarted and API verified working
3. **Container Health**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - All containers (app, postgres, redis) running in healthy state
4. **API Functionality**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - Survey submission API successfully processing requests

**Remaining Issues (Non-Critical):**
1. **Code Quality**: Black/Flake8 formatting improvements needed
2. **Security Enhancement**: Hardcoded passwords should be moved to environment variables
3. **Docker Configuration**: Syntax errors in Dockerfiles (containers build successfully despite warnings)
4. **Missing Files**: postgres/.dockerignore file should be created

## Key Development Workflows

### Adding New Survey Forms
1. **Route Setup**: Add new form routes in `app/routes/survey.py`
2. **Template Creation**: Create HTML template in `app/templates/survey/`
3. **Model Updates**: Update `Survey` model if new fields needed (use JSON `responses` field for flexibility)
4. **Admin Interface**: Add admin management to `app/routes/admin.py`
5. **JavaScript Logic**: Implement conditional logic matching exact HTML IDs

### SafeWork Admin Panel Extension
1. **Model Definition**: Add new models in `models_safework.py` or `models_safework_v2.py`
2. **API Endpoints**: Add RESTful endpoints in `api_safework_v2.py`
3. **Admin Routes**: Add admin interface routes in `admin.py`
4. **Templates**: Create admin templates in `templates/admin/safework/`
5. **Database Migration**: Use `python migrate.py create "Description"` for schema changes

### Container Deployment Testing
```bash
# Test individual container health before deployment
docker build -t test-app ./app && docker run --rm test-app python -c "import app; print('OK')"
docker build -t test-postgres ./postgres && docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_DB=test test-postgres postgres --version
docker build -t test-redis ./redis && docker run --rm test-redis redis-server --version

# Verify container networking
docker network inspect watchtower_default  # Check network exists
./scripts/portainer_simple.sh network      # Check production network config
```

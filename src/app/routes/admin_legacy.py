# This file has been modularized into admin/ directory
# Original admin.py has been split into:
# - admin/__init__.py (Blueprint setup and common decorators)
# - admin/dashboard.py (Main dashboard and general management)
# - admin/survey_management.py (Survey management, review, statistics)
# - admin/safework_core.py (SafeWork dashboard and core functions)
# - admin/workers.py (Worker management)
# - admin/health.py (Health checks and medical visits)
# - admin/medications.py (Medication inventory management)
# - admin/msds.py (MSDS management and chemical safety)

# Please use the modular admin system located in the admin/ directory.
# This legacy file is kept for reference only.

# To access admin functions, use:
# from routes.admin import admin_bp
# which automatically includes all modular blueprints.
